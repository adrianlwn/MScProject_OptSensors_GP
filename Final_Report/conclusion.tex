\todo{Change Conclusion of the Project}

In this report, we have stated some of the research that was done in order to solve the sensor position optimisation problem. \\ 

The biggest challenge here is to make the algorithm scalable for optimising over $100'000$ sensor locations. It requires to develop strategies to make the GPs scalable. The main other challenge is to find a method to accurately estimate the covariance matrix. \\

I have implemented some of the optimisation algorithm proposed on a smaller dataset and with a poor estimation of the covariance function. It has given consistent results and has proven that once the main challenges, described earlier are solved, we will have a good optimisation algorithm for that kind of setups.
