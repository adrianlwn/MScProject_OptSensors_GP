\chapter{Introduction}



The optimisation of sensor position is a very common problem in many applications. The reliability of very complex systems often depend on the choice sensor position. The cost induced by the incorrect placement or un-necessary sensor placement could be very important. There is therefore a real need for optimal sensor placement in the industry and in research applications. \\

Main Problem \\
Optimise sensor positions. Common Problem. \\



Solution to the Problem
Investigate and Explore the solution proposed by \citet{krause_near-optimal_2008} on near-optimal optimisation \\
\\ > Details on the Process
Gaussian Processes \\


Applications : \\
Application to the Problem of Data Assimilation. Assimilate data on a limited number of points. Use the optimal sensors for the Data Assimilation and see if the results are better than random.  Can be used on other sets.  \\

Challenge is the size of of the candidate set. \\
