\chapter*{Abstract}

Gaussian processes (GP) have been widely used since the 1970s in the fields of geostatistics and meteorology. Current applications are in diverse fields including sensor placement
In this project, we propose the employment of a GP model to calculate the optimal spatial positioning of sensors to study and collect air pollution data in big cities. We will then validate the results by means of a data assimilation software with the data at the proposed positions.
