\chapter{Ethical and Professional Considerations}


Throughout this project, I wasn't confronted to any ethical questions and have therefore not checked any item of the ethical consideration list. My project explored the application of a publication proposing an algorithm for near-optimal sensor positioning. Optimising sensor positions is a very broad subject that has applications in most of technical fields. I have applied those algorithms in an environmental context. By placing a reduced number of points in an optimal way, we can help improving the results of the simulations of pollution concentrations. We can also consider that such application can help broaden the number of similar studies by reducing the cost of actual sensor deployment. Our project can therefore be considered as respecting the ethical and professional considerations requirements.
