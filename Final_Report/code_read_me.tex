\chapter{Description of the Code} \label{appendix:code}

The codes created for this project are available in the \textbf{GitHub} repository of the project at the following address : \url{https://github.com/adrianlwn/MScProject\_OptSensors\_GP}. This repository contains a library named \texttt{utils} containing a several python files : 

\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{data\_handling.py}: All the functions used to handle the vtk files, extract the subsets for the optimisation. It also allows to save the results in the VTK files for the purpose of visualisation. 
	\item \texttt{sensor\_optimisation.py}: 
	\item \texttt{sensor\_optimisation\_tsvd.py}:  
	\item \texttt{config.py}:
	\item \texttt{data\_assimilation.py}: 
	\item  
\end{itemize}
