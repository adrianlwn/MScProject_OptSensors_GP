\paragraph{Project Proposal:}
Gaussian processes (GP) have been widely used since the 1970s in the fields of geostatistics and meteorology. Current applications are in diverse fields including sensor placement
In this project, we propose the employment of a GP model to calculate the optimal spatial positioning of sensors to study and collect air pollution data in big cities. We will then validate the results by means of a data assimilation software with the data at the proposed positions.

\paragraph{Dataset:} London South Bank University (LSBU) air pollution data (velocity, tracer)

\chapter{Conclusion}

In this report, we have stated some of the research that was done in order to solve the sensor position optimisation problem. \\ 

The biggest challenge here is to make the algorithm scalable for optimising over $100'000$ sensor locations. It requires to develop strategies to make the GPs scalable. The main other challenge is to find a method to accurately estimate the covariance matrix. \\

I have implemented some of the optimisation algorithm proposed on a smaller dataset and with a poor estimation of the covariance function. It has given consistent results and has proven that once the main challenges, described earlier are solved, we will have a good optimisation algorithm for that kind of setups.
